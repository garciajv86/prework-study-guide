        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to structure a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes define additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the child elements is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements—The name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web dev world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Headings are larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The header element usually appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and/or intriductory content.</li>
          <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,h1, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>The section element are elements that are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)—Programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. Used to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>Three Ways To Style Webpage Using CSS: (1). Inline CSS (2). Internal CSS Style Sheet (2). External CSS Style Sheet</li>
          <li>When a dev wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Theyre useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows devs to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTMLs head.</li>
          <li>Nerd Note: Separation of concern is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>CSS RULE: (1). Selector—Defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply. (2). Declarations—Contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. Example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>Margin Property—Indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding Property—Adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>It is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the elements borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS Box Model.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li> 
          <li>You can combine 2 selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declaration to affect both selectors. This helps write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          <li>IMPORTANT: Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to  reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>Besides text we can also apply CSS rules to images.</li>
          <li>link element creates the connection to the external file.</li> 
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attributes specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location. To locate the style sheet from the current location, use folder path and file.</li>
          <li>Class Attribute—Allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, Enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>.card—Class selector</li>
          <li>box-shadow—CSS property adds shadow effects around an elements frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box-shadow is described by x and y offsets relative to the element, blur, and spread radius, and color</li>
          <li>IMPORTANT: Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>The git command must precede every git statement.</li>
          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
          <li>The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <li>It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be deceloped by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
          <li>The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
          <li>Once files are staged to be committed, enter the git commit comand with a commit message that describes what the commit contains.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "add starter code". In the Git statement, a commit was created that captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes. Once committed, branch will be updated with starter code.</li>
          <li>Before push up to repo, double check if local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub. So pull down any changes from the base branch.</li>
          <li>To pull from main use the git command: git pull origin main.</li>
          <li>The pull command receives a branch's modifications into the local environment.</li>
          <li>The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo.</li>
          <li>The main keyword indicates the branch.</li>
          <li>It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work.</li>
          <li>Once local branch is in sync with the remote base branch, push changes to the remote branch by using the following command: git push origin 'branch file name'</li>
          <li>The command push push's the changes made locally to remote GitHub branch.</li>
          <li>When using the push command, you can create a new remote branch or add new changes to an existing branch.</li>
          <li>Now in the GitHub repo, select the branch from the drop down. Select the "Comparae & pull request" button.</li>
          <li>Give the pull request(PR) a descriptive title. In the body add instructions for team members that will review the PR about what changes were made, how the feature is supposed to function, and how to start the application so the feature can be tested.</li>
          <li>To merge the branch to the main branch, designate the base branch as main and the comparison branch as branch wanting to merge. Next, select the "Create Pull Request" button to make PR.</li>
          <li>request team member to review the code before it is merged into the base branch. GitHub has a pull request review feature that has a quality assurance step necessary to ensure that only completed, quality code is merged into the base branch.</li>
          <li>Use GitHub work flow to make sure our GitHub repo is in sync with what's on our own computer.</li>
          <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code and testion their solutions.</li>
          <li>The first step to creating a local development version is to create a feature branch. This branch is where we add our new code.</li>
          <li>Our default branch is called main, but master may also be used in older versions.</li>
          <li>So basically we branch off the main branch and create a feature branch, which is a copy of the main branch.</li>
          <li>The feature branch is how we track changes that are made and maintain the main branch.</li>
          <li>When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app.</li>
          <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working. We add a commit message that is descriptive of what changed in the code.</li>
          <li>COMMIT OFTEN!</li>
          <li>Then we push up the changes to our feature branch in our GitHub repo. But that code is still in our feature branch. In order to merge changes to main we open a PR.</li>
          <li>A pull request is used t merge a comparison branch into the base branch.</li>
          <li>Once PR is opened, other dev's and collaborators on team can view those changes made to code.</li>
          <li>Once PR is approved, it can then be merged into the main branch.</li>
          <li>From then on if new changes need to be made then branch of the newly updated main branch.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS)— is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and make it interactive.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
          <li>Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object (which could also make up an excuse for typeof null === “object”). The language usually defaults to undefined when something is devoid of a value.</li>
          <li>Null is a keyword, but undefined is a normal identifier that happens to be a global property.</li>
          <li>Nerd Note: A .js file extension indicates that the file is a JavaScript file.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. Finally, we use the assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>console.log method—Method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>We use the script tag in our HTML file to link our JS file.</li>
          <li>Use Chrome DevTools to View console.log Output:

            (1) While looking at your index.html file in the browser, right-click anywhere in the browser window and select “inspect” from the menu.
            You can also open Chrome DevTools using keyboard command. If youre using macOS, you can press Command+Options+I.
            
            (2) Click the Console tab and you should see a web console.\
            </li>
            <li>Control Flow— The order in which a computer executes code in a script. Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
            <li>If statement—A way of introducing decision-making into code. The code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
            <li>A value is considered false if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, “”, null, undefined, NaN, or a Bool data type with the value of false. All other values are considered truthy. </li>
            <li>If we have more than one condition we can use else if</li>
            <li>Array—A single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Typically used to hold data that is related in some way. Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT:
              Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
            <li>When working with single data items, we simply use the variable name to access the stored data. 
              To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece of datas index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array. Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time. If we wanted to access only a certain item, we start with the name of the variable that stores the array then we add the index of the item to the end of the array name in square brackets. </li>
            <li>for loop- Uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.To use the for loop, we need to know the items index and the arrays length. The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length. Devs must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>  
            <li>(1) Keyword "for"
              (2) Three-part conditional statement
              (3) Code bloc</li>
            <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:

              (1) The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0.
              
              (2) The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running.
              
              (3) The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1.
              </li>
            <li>Finally, we put the code that we want to be executed for each loop inside curly brackets. In place of the index number we can add the variable x form our for loop.</li>
            <li>Function— Simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. You must call a function by name in order to execute it.
              To create a function, we use the function keyword, similar to how we used the var keyword to declare a new variable. Then we give the function a unique name.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: A functions name is followed by parentheses. This is to define parameters that can be placed inside the parenthesis.</li> 
            <li>The code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets.
                Note that it is common practice to indent the for loop code below the function name,  within the curly brackets, to add visual structure to your code.</li>
            <li>Nerd Note: Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScripts built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li> 
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
